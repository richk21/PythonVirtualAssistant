# PythonVirtualAssistant
This project is a python based virtual assistant. I have made use of modules like speech recognition, pywhatkit and pyttsx3 for it.
The key word is the word 'Python' just like how we use 'Alexa' to activate the echo devices. 
You can ask it to tell the time like, 'Python tell me the time'. It can play youtube videos and search google.
instructions:
1. import all the libraries: speech recognition, pywhatkit, datetime, pyttsx3
2. run the project
3. It'll start with the system asking you to 'Say something...'
4. then just say 'Python, search <insert whatever you want to google>' or 'Python, play <whichever video you'd like watch>' or 'Python, tell time'.
